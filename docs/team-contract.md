# Team Contract

## Roles

- Ted is our team lead and is responsible for coordinating the project.
- Michelle leads the UI/UX and design of the app.
- Cliff leads the backend architecture and engineering.
- Andy leads frontend architecture and engineering. 
- Anirudh leads the integration and end-to-end testing of the app.

## Communication

- Our team will use Discord group chat to communicate project-related matters.
- We will meet every week on Wednesday at 5:30 pm.

## Meetings

- All members will attend these meetings or notify the team in advance of anticipated absences. We all agree that absences should be rare.
- All group members will come to the meetings prepared by:
  - reading the assigned material (as much as possible), and
  - coming with ideas pertaining to the tasks and decisions to be made.
- Members will not work on other assignments during meetings and will be engaged.
- Decisions can be made during meetings even some members are absent.
- Each member will take turns listening as well as talking, and active listening will be a strategy for all group discussions.
- Disagreements will be solved democratically, with binary decisions taking on a vote that requires at least a 4-2 majority to pass. 

- Ted will post the agenda for the week in our group chat each Monday.
- Cliff will take notes during all meetings.
