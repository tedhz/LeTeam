# LeTeam

Locked is a social media app built to capture every authentic moment of a user’s fitness journey to share with their community. 

Users will input their fitness goals and schedule, and Locked will send a daily notification for the user to post a photo of their workout, which will be viewable to all users in their network. Users can follow their friends or athletes to build up this personal network; however, the one caveat is that users must first post their prompted fitness photo before viewing the ones in their network, motivating users to stay motivated with their goals.
